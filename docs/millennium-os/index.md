# MillenniumOS - An "Operations System" for RepRapFirmware

MillenniumOS is an addon for RepRapFirmware 3.5+ which implements some high-level functionality around work-piece probing, tool changes and tool setting that aim to make Millennium Machines the simplest route for novice machinists to make their first cuts confidently and safely.

MillenniumOS provides post-processors for common CAD/CAM packages (currently Fusion360 and others that use the same `.cps` format), as well as implementing a gcode dialect that makes machining on a Milo feel a little more like using a 3D printer - that is, the gcode generated by our post-processors is able to walk the operator through work-piece probing and tool changes that otherwise would be entirely manual or require significant implementation of custom macros to do safely.
